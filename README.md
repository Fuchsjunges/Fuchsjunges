- 👋 Hi, I'm {%h/=}.
- 🌱 I currently program mainly in Python, but I’m also interested in learning other programming languages.
- 🐈 Cats rule the world. They are simply to lazy to use their power
- 📫 How to reach me: You won’t reach me. Use my code or not, but expect nothing special from me.
- ⚡ Fun fact: 99% of all fun facts aren’t funny.
-  ❗ I sign my code with "{%h/=}". Please consider keeping it if you use my code, I'd be happy to see it in someone else's code someday.
